About Us

Dedan Kimathi University of Technology Innovation and Incubation Centre (DeHUB) was founded in 2015 by Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT). The incubation centre was established with the goal of inspiring innovation and entrepreneurship by way of transforming innovative ideas emanating from within and outside DeKUT community into products, processes and services for commercial exploitation. This is intended to benefit the originators of those ideas, the university and the society at large. To achieve this, DeHUB operates an Incubator to facilitate incubation of enterprise start-ups by providing them with physical, technical, business and networking services.
Our Vision

To be a world-class Centre for inspiring creativity, innovation and exchange of ideas for sustainable development
Our Mission

To create an enabling environment that will foster entrepreneurial spirit within and without DeKUT community through consultancy, research, training, promotion, connections, and incubation thereby stimulating innovation and knowledge-based entrepreneurship and business growth nationally and internationally.
